## Usage

### Running the Application
You can run the application using the `Main` class. Below is the content of the `Main.java` file:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import com.example.demo.controller.MagicalArena;
import com.example.demo.entity.Player;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Player playerA = new Player("Player A", 10, 5, 100);
        Player playerB = new Player("Player B", 8, 4, 80);

        System.out.println("Starting the fight...");
        MagicalArena.executeFight(playerA, playerB, 1);  // Player A attacks
        MagicalArena.executeFight(playerB, playerA, 2);  // Player B attacks
    }
}
To run the main application, execute the following command:

sh

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.demo.Main"

Alternatively, you can run the Main class from your IDE by setting it as the main class and running the project.
Running Tests

Unit tests are included in the src/test directory and use JUnit 5. To run the tests, execute the following command:
